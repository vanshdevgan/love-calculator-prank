# love-calculator-prank
The Name Of The Project Is Love Calculator Prank It is Written in PHP by me. It is a clone of https://quiz.playing.com I have taken the frontend from there site and implemented the backend in core PHP using the basic or advance PHP skills which I know that
# How It Works - Tried To Explain How This PHP SCRIPT WORK 
1-When User Enter His Her Name In Input Field There Is Two Hidden Input Field Which Has Randomly Generated Value I Call This Value Known As secreted and userid, when user submits  the data, got inserted into DB in the corresponding column with name, secretid,userid .<br/>
2- After Submitting The Data In DB The Page sends the get request to https://example.com/index.php?userid=genrateduserid now it's an interesting page this page has two views 
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 authorized view 
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 unauthorized view<br/>
<br/>3-The Cookie Has Also Been Created With The Values Of secretid and userid to differentiate in these views a person having these cookies gonna have authorized view as long as they have a cookie in their browser also the page renders a short link which users can share with their friends the short link has been created using a third party API the API uses <b>$finalurl.'?'.$_COOKIE['userid'] </b>these variables to create a short link 
<br/>4-When User Share The Link & Victim Visits The Link Name Of Ther Person(WHo Created The Link) Will Be Reflected (Because Of Get Paramterer In User Id)In Unauthorized View Where Victim Can ENter His Crush Name & His Name 
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5- There Are Three Fields In Total  & one submit button
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.1-Your Name- It Is Visible Field Victim Can Enter His Name
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.2-Crush Name - It is Visibile Field Victim Can Enter His Crush Name
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.3-secretid- it is not visible field and it has default value fetched from get parameter in the request by which this unauth page has been rendered and that parameter is userid 
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.4-Calculate Love Button- This Button Sends Data In Another Table Having Two Columns Secretid and message in which every secret id has one corresponding column named messages
<br/>5- Now If Authorized Users Go To https://example.com/ the PHP script checks for a cookie if it is there then it redirects to https://example.com/index.php?userid=genrateduserid and there as he is authorized there the messages having secret id he generated will be rendered hence the Victim Name & Crush Name Will Be Rendered
